## Computer Vision vs. Image Processing

Computer Vision and Image Processing are two closely related fields, but they have distinct goals and methodologies.

Computer Vision focuses on the extraction of information from images, it goes from an image as the input to a set of information as the output.
Image Processing, on the other hand, focuses on the manipulation and trasformation of images, it goes from an image as the input to another image as the output.

Usually we use Image Processing techniques as a pre-processing step for Computer Vision tasks in ordeer to enhance the quality of the images and make it easier to extract information from them.

## Paradigms and Timeline

Over the years, Computer Vision has evolved through different paradigms:

### Fully programmed paradigm

Tipically in CV processes we do not directly extract information from images BUT from a pre-processed object called feature. The information extraction process is tipically called **decision rule**.

Tipically in CV processes we have several steps:
1. **image acquisition** to get the raw input image
2. **representation** step to pre elaborate the image and extract **features**
3. **decision rule** step to extract the final information from the features

In this paradigm, both the representation step and the decision rule step are **fully programmed**, meaning that they are designed and implemented by human, using pre-defined algorithms and heuristics.

> basically a chain of if-else statements

This paradigm is suitable for simple tasks where the variability of the input data is limited and the rules for extracting information can be easily defined. However, it struggles with more complex tasks where the input data is highly variable and the rules are not easily defined.

### Hybrid programmed and learned paradigm

In this paradigm, the representation step is still fully programmed, but the decision rule step is learned from data using machine learning techniques.

This approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability in the decision rule step, as it can learn from data and improve its performance over time. However, it still relies on the quality of the features extracted in the representation step, which can limit its effectiveness in some cases.

### Fully learned paradigm

In this paradigm, both the representation step and the decision rule step are learned from data using **deep learning** techniques.

> basically a big neural network

Given a purpose, the system learns what features to extract and how to use them to make decisions, all from the training data. This approach has shown remarkable success in a wide range of computer vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in many benchmarks.

#### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are both subsets of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focus on enabling computers to learn from data. However, they differ in their approaches and capabilities.

Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. It typically requires feature extraction, where human experts manually select and engineer features from the raw data to be used for training the model. Common ML algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors.

Deep Learning, on the other hand, is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to automatically learn features and representations from raw data. DL models can learn hierarchical features, where higher-level features are built upon lower-level ones, allowing them to capture complex patterns in the data. Common DL architectures include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
